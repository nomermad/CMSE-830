# CMSE-830

This is a github repository for my midterm project, studying the relationship between unemployment rates and homicide cases in the United States from 2010-2014. There are a few files in this repository. The first two are datasets, which include the homicide dataframe and the unemployment dataset, both found on kaggle. Moreover, there is a Juypter notebook, which contains most of the code for my streamlit app. This is where the initial data processing occurred. Finally, there is a python file that contains all the code for the streamlit website. My streamlit app contains a lot of useful information and includes a lot of interactive features to do so. To start, the app is composed of three tabs on the navigation bar, which has data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. Under the data processing tab, you can view the homicide data and the unemployment data. There is an interactive drop down menu, where you can choose what table you want to see. Then, the missing values of both tables were put into a heatmap, which is interactive as well and you can use the drop down menu to choose what table you want to see. To move to the exploratory data analysis page, you can select it from the drop down menu. The first interactive feature on this page is choosing to look at specific features in a table and comparing those features. The mean value was found for relevant columns, and you can click the checkbox to display which mean values you would like to look at. Finally, you can see the visualizations by clicking on the visualization tab. 6 graphs were created, and you can click the drop down button to choose which graph you want to view.
